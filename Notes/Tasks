Extract many many words from wikipedia of kannada
	Identify whether it is kannada using unicode and then store the sentence in utf-8

Train the embeddings for the remaining %age of words

Check that in different contexts the words have differnt meaning
	how does embedding take care of this?

See the internal implementation of BiDirectional layer

Do prefix matching for the words
	And print for each word, at each prefix length how many words match
	(Almost like stemming)

	Use the oov variable info
	
Find out a way in which we can find embeddings for unknown words from using partially known embeddings(49% one)

Self-supervised tasks
	Learning from unlabelled data

	1. MULTI-MASK LANGUAGE MODELING
	2. NEXT SENTENCE PREDICTION (from the list of given options of sentences)
	3. 

BERT
	Pre-training
		1. Masked Language Modeling
			15% of the tokens are chosen
				mask 80% of the time
				replace them with random token 10% of the time
				keep them as is for 10% of the time
			Dense layer and softmax

		2. Next sentence prediction
	
	Position embeddings
		Position in the sentence
		Segment Embeddings --> sentence A or sentence B --> see how its actually implemented
		Token Embeddings --> [CLS] at front and [SEP] at end

		Take the sum?
