Extract many many words from wikipedia of kannada
	Identify whether it is kannada using unicode and then store the sentence in utf-8

Train the embeddings for the remaining %age of words

Check that in different contexts the words have differnt meaning
	how does embedding take care of this?

See the internal implementation of BiDirectional layer

Do prefix matching for the words
	And print for each word, at each prefix length how many words match
	(Almost like stemming)

	Use the oov variable info
	
Find out a way in which we can find embeddings for unknown words from using partially known embeddings(49% one)
