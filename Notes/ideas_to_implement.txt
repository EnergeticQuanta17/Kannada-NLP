1. Effect of finding POS tags after morph
    But we need morphs to classify POS tags right

    Then why does 21 say "Without using Morphological Features"

2. Check what are we doing for words without word embeddings

3. Effect of block train-validation-test splitting

4. Effect of sorting according to sentence length and training

5. Print the confusion matrix for the Bi-LSTM RNN model
    Vertical --> True Label
    Horizontal --> Predicted Label

6. How to cover that we copied code?
    Also can try adding extra layers

7.
