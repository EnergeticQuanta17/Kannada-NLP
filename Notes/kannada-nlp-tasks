Aligned Word Vectors
	We can use the structure used in other languages similar to Kannada to improvise the model

	In the context of aligned word vectors, it refers to the process of mapping or aligning word vectors from different languages onto a shared vector space. Aligned word vectors allow for comparisons and analysis between languages, as words with similar meanings or semantic relationships are positioned closer to each other in the shared vector space

	By aligning word vectors across languages, it becomes possible to perform cross-lingual tasks such as machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, or understanding semantic relationships between words in different languages. Aligned word vectors provide a valuable resource for multilingual natural language processing applications and research.
