    See the number of parameters used for each UNITS_IN_LSTM_LAYER

2. Attention mechanism after to extract features from concatenated hidden states

3. Custom training accuracy and loss

*** Check how to print correct validation and test accuracy
    If we can fix this, the model itself can improve on its own ig

*** Something with the model itself I feel
    It can accept None as the first shape, then it must be BATCH_SIZE as the second dimension of the first layer shape right
