BERT

1. Give more penalty in proportion of the overall ratio of that POS tag for choosing that POS tag

2. Find out how to train the model fast

3. Fix the assertion error for 1 hideen layer

4. Remove the nouns altogether and see the accuracy

5. Check the gradients for higher learning rate

6. What is the ratio of nouns in the data is it close to 33%
	How much % change in the paramters happened to give 33% accuracy

	See how much change of weights is happening on each step
		Use the norm or something to measure the change	

		Or use the abs and sum-up

7. Weighted error function

8. Normalization

9. Initalization is leading to a bad local minima, see what is being initialized for the weights in the middle

10. Find a way to access the syntactic and semantic structure of the Language
