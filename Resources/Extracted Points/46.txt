    1. What are sequential distortions?

    2. Drawbacks of RNNs? 
        "several drawbacks"

    3.  How to get to know that its hard to store information for long periods of time?

    4. LSTM came in 1997

    5. Page 1 --> some papers show that it is capable of storing and accessing information over very long timespans

    6. BiDirectional LSTM --> first time in "2005b"
