Questions:-
    1. 1 para says "Without using Morphological Features"
        How better does the model do after doing morph analysis

    2. Why is it "awkward" to make use of conventional features such as morph features
        It says because too large input
        But aren't they very useful information

        Simple capital features

    3. "conquer"
        We must also conquer many difficulties in our paper

    4. "demonstrate"
        We can demonstrate for other Indian Languages which have morph features
    
    5. 

Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTMRNN)
has been shown to be very effective
for tagging sequential data
